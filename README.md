# Potential Questions
Some questions I've considered with preliminary knowledge of Simpsons episodes and early observation of colums / variables.

- Anything interesting about 100th ep?
- Who killed Mr. Burns episode (Televised as big event for viewer interaction/prize (?))
- Pre vs Post-Movie patterns
- Holiday specials patterns? (Treehouse of Horror (Halloween), Christmas, etc.)
    - Usually parodies cultural trends i.e. Marvel movies (if Avengers released, will following special have higher view / ratings?)
    - External research required
- Difference b/w descriptions (Homer-centric episode vs Bart, etc.)
- Patterns in ratings / view count
- Certain other cultural shifts i.e. rise of streaming how affected cable viewership
- Director vs Writers etc
- Controvery of Apu voice actor, death of Ms. Krabappel, etc.
